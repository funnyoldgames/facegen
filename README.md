# facegen

## What is facegen?

facegen is a tool for generating faces. It was designed for the game [Legacy Manager](https://legacymanager.net) but is free to use for any purpose.

In contrast to the myriad of AI tools on the market these days, facegen is designed to produce fun, cartoonish images rather than realistic faces.

# How do I use facegen?

You can access the public version on my website at [WillGrey.co/facegen](https://willgrey.co/facegen), which includes a free-to-=use API, or you can take this project and run it yourself.
